# EDHUDChanger

This simple Windows Forms program using file I/O is designed to allow the user to select the location of the GraphicsConfiguration.xml file for Elite Dangerous. At that point, the user can select a new color scheme for his/her HUD and write the file in just a few clicks.

This is a WIP and is not complete as of the last commit.
